# ZEN player

## [Live Demo](http://simurai.github.io/ZEN-Player)

### Note

This player is just meant as a __demo__ and not really made to be used on a real site. ;-)
It would need lots of fixes, more features and some documentation.

You're certainly free to use the player however you like (except selling it somewhere), but unfortunately I can't make modifications to your specific needs.

Thanks for your understanding, simurai

ps. If you know some JS and would like to help out develop this player further, that would be awesome.

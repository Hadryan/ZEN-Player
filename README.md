## [Demo](http://simurai.github.io/ZEN-Player)

### Note

This player is just meant as a __demo__ and not really made to be used on a real site. ;-)
It would need lots of fixes, more features and some documentation before it would be ready.

You're certainly free to use the player however you like (except selling it somewhere), but unfortunately I can't provide any support in case something doesn't work.

Thanks for your understanding, simurai
